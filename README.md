This is a feature loaded weather forecasting website.



## 5 Main Features

- Weather forecasting for next 4 days
- Temperature v/s Time graph for next 36 hours
- 5 hotspot cities to direct access their weather on landing page
- Top weather news
- Sunrise, sunset timing 

## Basics:
### APIs used by me:
1. Openweather API to get real time data for that city and 3 hour-5day functionality for forecasting weather conditions for that city.
2. NewsAPI to get top weather news from whole world.
3. Flagsapi to get flags for the country of the searched city


### Functioning:
- The  core of functioning of this weather forecasting is quite simple, I had to just show the data which I fetched from the API.
- Thus CSS has to taake charge to make a baasic functioning website into a eye-catching and pleasant website, I had added many CSS to this website to do so.
- I had made this website with kind of bluish theme and for further info you can go through "More info" section or visit the website.

### Landing page
- The main highlight of landing page is the Parallax effect and the Coverflow effect. The slide on top changes with the change in slides of Coverflow element, I called them as "Hotspot locations".

- Then comes the weather news part, where news api is not allowing to show me news due to developer account, but still I had placed it right there.
- The next big thing is the "Know element part", here I have used slides to show diffrent elements contributing to any weather, I have used animations here.
